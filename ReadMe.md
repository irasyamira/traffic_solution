## Traffic Solution for Indus 2019
#### Aim: To automate the process of reporting traffic violations through the use of machine learning.

###### The system takes in a short clip of a traffic condition at an intersection, then outputs a violation code prediction.
###### The system has been trained to identify two types of violation: Vehicle occupying the yellow box and Vehicle blocking the pedestrian path.
###### The system is a purely software system (i.e. do not need hardware interface to make prediction).


###### Note: This project has been completed (Sept 2019) and is no longer active. No future improvements will be made.
